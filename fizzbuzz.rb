# The goal of FizzBuzz is to build a program that can take a number and if the number is evenly divisible by 3, it should return "Fizz",
# if it's divisible by 5, it should return "Buzz", and if it's divisible by both
# 3 and 5, it should return "FizzBuzz".

def fizzbuzz(num)
if (num % 3 == 0)
    return "Fizz"
    elsif   ((num % 3 == "Fizz") && (num % 5 == "Buzz"))
      return "FizzBuzz"
    elsif (num % 5 == 0)
      return "Buzz"
    else (num /15 == 0)
         "FizzBuzz"
    
end
      return nil
